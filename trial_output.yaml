      I''ve found that Python is just way too slow for common use - I''m mainly interested
      in using it to help me learn the ropes and write small apps quickly.

      i guess what you are asking is "what programming language is best to learn javascript
      with?".  python is faster than c++ but slower than javascript. but definitely
      not as fast as java/c#/ruby.  you probably need to look at a few different ones.  you
      probably need to look at a few different ones.  you probably need to look at
      a few different ones.

      But what can I program with it? For example, I''m interested in writing a twitter-like
      application, and I''m not sure what sort of performance I should expect.'
